# SQUARE TERROR P5 GAME

## Project

This is just a piece of code I wrote to test the p5 library. The game idea is stolen from a game called "Square Terror" which I played a lot when I was younger.

## Rules

Your mission is to connect the squares with same color. If you manage to connect more then three squares you will be rewarded with points. The points are calculated with the number of collected squares times the number of collected squares. Eg. if you connect four squares you will get 4^2 points.

But(!), to do this much harder, you can only collect points by each column. With other words, if you move right or left you can not collect any points, but if you move up or down you can. And you have only 64 moves!
